## Write Faster Code by Adding VIM to Visual Studio
1. One of the greatest productivity gains you can make is to type less and navigate through your code faster. VsVim, is an extension for Visual Studio 2010 and later which will get you doing just that. To get VsVim, you can download it from the Visual Studio Gallery or via the extension manager in Visual Studio. Mastering VsVim takes an investment of time, but learning it will pay dividends.
2. In addition to all this, you still get IntelliSense, tab completion, snippets and all other base Visual Studio features when in insert mode. There's built in support for key binding collisions, enabling you to choose if VsVim or Visual Studio itself will handle the shortcuts; just click the options button in the bottom right of your code file. If you need to exit VsVim, you can temporarily disable (and restore) it by pressing Ctrl+Shift+F12.

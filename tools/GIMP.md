## Single-Window Mode
1. GIMP 2.8 introduces an optional single-window mode. You can toggle between the default multi-window mode and the new single-window mode through the Single-window mode checkbox in the Windows menu. In single-window mode, GIMP will put dockable dialogs and images in a single, tabbed image window. The single-window mode setting is of course preserved if you quit and start GIMP again. Single-window mode removes the necessity for users of having to deal with multiple windows.

## Layer Groups
1. For complex compositions, a flat layer structure is very limiting. GIMP 2.8 lets users organize their compositions better through the introduction of layer groups which allow layers to be organized in tree-like structures. Layer groups are fully scriptable through the GIMP plug-in API.

## Simple Math In Size Entries[GIMP 2.8]
1. Enhancements have also been made to the size entry widget, which is used for inputting most of the x, y, width, height parameters. For example, in the scale dialog it is now possible to write ‘50%’ in the Width field to scale the image to 50% of the width. Expressions such as ‘30in + 40px’ and ‘4 * 5.4in’ work, too.

## How do I select a layer “sitting” under the mouse cursor in Gimp?

> In "Preferences" dialog box click on "Tool Options" and enable the "set layer or path as active" option. Close the "Preferences".
> Select "Move Tool" (shortcut - m), Now Click on your desired object and it's layer will be selected automatically. Hare's an example!

> show tabs in single row

## What do the grey hints ("msg:", "context:", etc.) mean in Android Studio? How to make use of them? 
> That's called parameter hints. 2017.3 Nov 30, IntelliJ IDEA
> To make the code even more readable, the editor now shows hints for the parameter names in method calls where the meaning of the arguments may not be clear from the context.
> Similarly to Parameter Hints, the editor now is capable of showing inferred types for the variables, functions, and parameters. This functionality is disabled by default; you can enable it in the editor appearance settings.

## How to quickly find the fully qualified name of a class
> Pressing `Ctrl+Q` when the cursor is inside the class name, will show you the class's package name and the Javadoc for that class. `Esc` will then close the window.
> If I hold Ctrl and hover over the class name Element with my mouse, I get a popup with the following information.

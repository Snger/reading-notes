> It is possible! You need to share a project with your friend â€” all you do in DataGrip is in the context of a project. If you did not create a new one, everything is under the default project.

> In my case, I wanted to move project level data sources from phpStorm to DataGrip and this worked: `mv my-project/.idea/dataSources dataSources.* ~/Library/Preferences/DataGrip2017.2/projects/default/.idea/`

## What's ASP.NET?
1. ASP.NET is an open-source server-side web application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages. It was developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, web applications and web services.
2. It was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework, and is the successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) technology. ASP.NET is built on the Common Language Runtime (CLR), allowing programmers to write ASP.NET code using any supported .NET language. The ASP.NET SOAP extension framework allows ASP.NET components to process SOAP messages.
3. ASP.NET's successor is ASP.NET Core. It is a re-implementation of ASP.NET as a modular web framework, together with other frameworks like Entity Framework. The new framework uses the new open-source .NET Compiler Platform (codename "Roslyn") and is cross platform. ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and ASP.NET Web Pages (a platform using only Razor pages) have merged into a unified MVC 6.

## What's ADO.NET?
1. ADO.NET is a set of classes that expose data access services for .NET Framework programmers. ADO.NET provides a rich set of components for creating distributed, data-sharing applications. It is an integral part of the .NET Framework, providing access to relational, XML, and application data. ADO.NET supports a variety of development needs, including the creation of front-end database clients and middle-tier business objects used by applications, tools, languages, or Internet browsers.
2. ADO.NET separates data access from data manipulation into discrete components that can be used separately or in tandem. ADO.NET includes .NET Framework data providers for connecting to a database, executing commands, and retrieving results. Those results are either processed directly, placed in an ADO.NET DataSet object in order to be exposed to the user in an ad hoc manner, combined with data from multiple sources, or passed between tiers. The DataSet object can also be used independently of a .NET Framework data provider to manage data local to the application or sourced from XML.
3. The ADO.NET classes are found in System.Data.dll, and are integrated with the XML classes found in System.Xml.dll. 
4. ADO.NET provides the most direct method of data access within the .NET Framework. For a higher-level abstraction that allows applications to work against a conceptual model instead of the underlying storage model, see the ADO.NET Entity Framework.

## What's ADO.NET DataSet?
1. The ADO.NET DataSet is a memory-resident representation of data that provides a consistent relational programming model regardless of the source of the data it contains. A DataSet represents a complete set of data including the tables that contain, order, and constrain the data, as well as the relationships between the tables.

## LINQ to DataSet
1. LINQ to DataSet makes it easier and faster to query over data cached in a DataSet object. Specifically, LINQ to DataSet simplifies querying by enabling developers to write queries from the programming language itself, instead of by using a separate query language. This is especially useful for Visual Studio developers, who can now take advantage of the compile-time syntax checking, static typing, and IntelliSense support provided by the Visual Studio in their queries.
2. LINQ to DataSet can also be used to query over data that has been consolidated from one or more data sources. This enables many scenarios that require flexibility in how data is represented and handled, such as querying locally aggregated data and middle-tier caching in Web applications. In particular, generic reporting, analysis, and business intelligence applications require this method of manipulation.
3. The LINQ to DataSet functionality is exposed primarily through the extension methods in the DataRowExtensions and DataTableExtensions classes.

## Retrieving and Modifying Data in ADO.NET
1. A primary function of any database application is connecting to a data source and retrieving the data that it contains. The .NET Framework data providers of ADO.NET serve as a bridge between an application and a data source, allowing you to execute commands as well as to retrieve data by using a DataReader or a DataAdapter. A key function of any database application is the ability to update the data that is stored in the database. In ADO.NET, updating data involves using the DataAdapter and DataSet, and Command objects; and it may also involve using transactions.

## Connecting to a Data Source in ADO.NET
1. In ADO.NET you use a Connection object to connect to a specific data source by supplying necessary authentication information in a connection string. The Connection object you use depends on the type of data source.
2. Each .NET Framework data provider included with the .NET Framework has a DbConnection object: the .NET Framework Data Provider for OLE DB includes an OleDbConnection object, the .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server includes a SqlConnection object, the .NET Framework Data Provider for ODBC includes an OdbcConnection object, and the .NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle includes an OracleConnection object.

## Transactions and Concurrency
1. A transaction consists of a single command or a group of commands that execute as a package. Transactions allow you to combine multiple operations into a single unit of work. If a failure occurs at one point in the transaction, all of the updates can be rolled back to their pre-transaction state.
2. A transaction must conform to the ACID properties—atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability—in order to guarantee data consistency. Most relational database systems, such as Microsoft SQL Server, support transactions by providing locking, logging, and transaction management facilities whenever a client application performs an update, insert, or delete operation.
3. [Note] Transactions that involve multiple resources can lower concurrency if locks are held too long. Therefore, keep transactions as short as possible.
4. If a transaction involves multiple tables in the same database or server, then explicit transactions in stored procedures often perform better. You can create transactions in SQL Server stored procedures by using the Transact-SQL BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT TRANSACTION, and ROLLBACK TRANSACTION statements. For more information, see SQL Server Books Online.

## What's ACID?
1. Atomic – All statements in the transaction either completed successfully or they were all rolled back. The task that the set of operations represents is either accomplished or not, but in any case not left half-done, to the detriment of your data.
2. Consistent – All data touched by the transaction is left in a logically consistent state. For example, if inventory numbers were decremented in one table, there has to be a related order that consumed that inventory. The inventory can't just disappear.
3. Isolated – The transaction must affect data without interfering with other concurrent transactions, or being interfered with by them. This prevents transactions from making changes to data based on uncommitted information, for example changes to a record that are subsequently rolled back. Most databases use locking to maintain transaction isolation.
4. Durable – The data changes enacted by the transaction are permanent, and will persist through a system failure.

## Anatomy of a Transaction
> A transaction at its most basic level consists of two required steps—Begin, and then either Commit or Rollback. The Begin call defines the start of the transaction boundary, and the call to either Commit or Rollback defines the end of it. Within the transaction boundary, all of the statements executed are considered to be part of a unit for accomplishing the given task, and must succeed or fail as one. Commit (as the name suggests) commits the data modifications if everything was successful, and Rollback undoes the data modifications if an error occurs. All of the .NET data providers provide similar classes and methods to accomplish these operations.

## Local Transactions
> Transactions in ADO.NET are used when you want to bind multiple tasks together so that they execute as a single unit of work. For example, imagine that an application performs two tasks. First, it updates a table with order information. Second, it updates a table that contains inventory information, debiting the items ordered. If either task fails, the both updates are rolled back.

## Determining the Transaction Type
1. A transaction considered to be a local transaction when it is a single-phase transaction and is handled by the database directly. Transactions are considered to be distributed transactions when they are coordinated by a transaction monitor and use fail-safe mechanisms (such as two-phase commit) for transaction resolution.
2. Each of the .NET Framework data providers has its own Transaction object for performing local transactions. If you require a transaction to be performed in a SQL Server database, select a System.Data.SqlClient transaction. For an Oracle transaction, use the System.Data.OracleClient provider. In addition, there is a new DbTransaction class that is available for writing provider-independent code that requires transactions.

## [System.Data.Common] DbTransaction Class
1. The base class for a transaction.
2. Namespace:   System.Data.Common; Assembly:  System.Data (in System.Data.dll)

## System.Web Namespaces
1. The System.Web namespaces contain types that enable browser/server communication. Child namespaces include types that support ASP.NET forms authentication, application services, data caching on the server, ASP.NET application configuration, dynamic data, HTTP handlers, JSON serialization, incorporating AJAX functionality into ASP.NET, ASP.NET security, and web services.

## System.Web Namespace
1. The System.Web namespace supplies classes and interfaces that enable browser-server communication. This namespace includes the HttpRequest class, which provides extensive information about the current HTTP request; the HttpResponse class, which manages HTTP output to the client; and the HttpServerUtility class, which provides access to server-side utilities and processes. System.Web also includes classes for cookie manipulation, file transfer, exception information, and output cache control.
2. The System.Web namespace contains extension class for HTTP context.
3. [Class] HttpContextBaseExtensions: Provides extension methods for HttpContextBase.
4. [Class] HttpContextExtensions: Provides extension methods for HttpContext.

## HttpContext Class
1. Encapsulates all HTTP-specific information about an individual HTTP request.
2. [Constructor] HttpContext(HttpRequest, HttpResponse): Initializes a new instance of the HttpContext class by using the specified request and response objects.
3. [Constructor] HttpContext(HttpWorkerRequest): Initializes a new instance of the HttpContext class that uses the specified worker-request object.

## ASP.NET C# Static Variables are global?
1. For non-generic types there is a single static variable per AppDomain
2. For generic types there is one per generic instantiation per AppDomain
3. Static classes and class members are used to create data and functions that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. Static class members can be used to separate data and behavior that is independent of any object identity: the data and functions do not change regardless of what happens to the object. Static classes can be used when there is no data or behavior in the class that depends on object identity.
4. A static method, field, property, or event is callable on a class even when no instance of the class has been created. If any instances of the class are created, they cannot be used to access the static member. Only one copy of static fields and events exists, and static methods and properties can only access static fields and static events. Static members are often used to represent data or calculations that do not change in response to object state; for instance, a math library might contain static methods for calculating sine and cosine.
5. Not sure how many people realize it, but when you start dealing with multiple users access a system (in this case a web server), you have to be very careful what you store in static’s (global variables).  This is because all the users will have access to this data and so if you create a page, you could allow them to see data that they shouldn’t.

## Generic Type Parameters (C# Programming Guide)
1. In a generic type or method definition, a type parameters is a placeholder for a specific type that a client specifies when they instantiate a variable of the generic type. 

## Global.asax Syntax
1. The Global.asax file, also known as the ASP.NET application file, is an optional file that contains code for responding to application-level and session-level events raised by ASP.NET or by HTTP modules. The Global.asax file resides in the root directory of an ASP.NET application. At run time, Global.asax is parsed and compiled into a dynamically generated .NET Framework class derived from the HttpApplication base class. ASP.NET is configured so that any direct URL request for the Global.asax file is automatically rejected; external users cannot download or view the code in it.
2. The Global.asax file is optional. You create it only if you want to handle application or session events.
3. uses Global.asax for some "global" variables, So from the ASPX pages, you can access those members by opening up the static Global class

## HttpApplication.BeginRequest Event
1. Occurs as the first event in the HTTP pipeline chain of execution when ASP.NET responds to a request.
2. The BeginRequest event signals the creation of any given new request. This event is always raised and is always the first event to occur during the processing of a request.

## ControllerBase.ViewBag Property
1. Gets the dynamic view data dictionary.
2. The ViewBag property enables you to dynamically share values from the controller to the view. It is a dynamic object which means it has no pre-defined properties. You define the properties you want the ViewBag to have by simply adding them to the property. In the view, you retrieve those values by using same name for the property.

## StreamReader Class
1. Implements a TextReader that reads characters from a byte stream in a particular encoding.
2. Namespace: System.IO , Assembly: mscorlib (in mscorlib.dll)
3. [method] ReadToEnd(): Reads all characters from the current position to the end of the stream.(Overrides TextReader.ReadToEnd().)

## HttpServerUtility.MapPath Method (String)
1. Returns the physical file path that corresponds to the specified virtual path.
2. Namespace: System.Web ; Assembly: System.Web (in System.Web.dll)
3. If path is null, the MapPath method returns the full physical path of the directory that contains the current request for the path. The relative path does not need to specify an existing file or folder for this method to return a value. However, you cannot specify a path outside of the Web application.

## Newtonsoft.Json.Linq
1. LINQ to JSON is an API for working with JSON objects. It has been designed with LINQ in mind to enable quick querying and creation of JSON objects. LINQ to JSON sits under the Newtonsoft.Json.Linq namespace.
2. JSON values can be read from a string using Parse(String).

## Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject
1. Represents a JSON object.
2. [Constructor] JObject(): Initializes a new instance of the JObject class.
3. [Constructor] JObject(Object): Initializes a new instance of the JObject class with the specified content.
4. [Propertie] Value<T>: Gets the JToken with the specified key converted to the specified type. (Inherited from JToken.)
5. [Propertie] Values<T>: Returns a collection of the child values of this token, in document order. (Inherited from JContainer.)

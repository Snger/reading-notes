## VoiceOver Getting Started Guide
> [VoiceOver Getting Started Guide](https://help.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/10.12/)

## Turning VoiceOver on and off
> You can turn VoiceOver on and off at any time; you don’t have to restart your computer or log in again.
> Here are ways to turn VoiceOver on or off:
> Press Command-F5. If VoiceOver is on, pressing Command-F5 turns it off.
> Use the Universal Access pane of System Preferences.
> If you set the Universal Access preference to include a Universal Access menu in the status bar, the menu shows when VoiceOver is on or off.
> The first time you start VoiceOver, you can choose to take the Quick Start tutorial, an interactive tour of VoiceOver navigation and interaction basics. When VoiceOver is on, you can start the tutorial at any time by pressing VO-Command-F8.

## Pausing speech
> When VoiceOver is speaking, you can temporarily pause the speech, and then resume where the speaking left off.
> To pause and resume speech:
> Press the Control key. If you’re using VoiceOver gestures, two-finger tap the trackpad. To resume speaking, repeat the key or gesture.
> If you move the VoiceOver cursor after you pause the speech, VoiceOver begins speaking the item that’s now in the VoiceOver cursor.
> If you missed what VoiceOver spoke, you can press VO-Z to repeat the last word or phrase.

## Locking the VO keys
> VoiceOver commands are entered by pressing the Control and Option keys (the VO keys) with function keys, arrow keys, and other keys. For example, to open the VoiceOver Help menu press VO-H.
> For convenience, you can lock the VO keys so you don’t have to press them while entering commands; all you need to press are the remaining keys for the command. For example, to open the VoiceOver Help menu, press H.
> To lock or unlock the VO keys:
Press VO-;.
> If you’re not familiar with the location of special keys on your keyboard, you can turn on keyboard help in VoiceOver.

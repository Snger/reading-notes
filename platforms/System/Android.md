> The android-apt plugin assists in working with annotation processors in combination with Android Studio. It has two purposes:
- Allow to configure a compile time only annotation processor as a dependency, not including the artifact in the final APK or library
- Set up the source paths so that code that is generated from the annotation processor is correctly picked up by Android Studio.

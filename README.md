>> 1. You are busy creating a website.
>> 2. You have a thought, “Oh, now I have to add an element.”
>> 3. Then another thought, “I feel so guilty adding a div. Div-itis is terrible, I hear.”
>> 4. Then, “I should use something else. The aside element might be appropriate.”
>> 5. Three searches and five articles later, you’re fairly confident that
aside is not semantically correct.
>> 6. You decide on article, because at least it’s not a div.
>> 7. You’ve wasted 40 minutes, with no tangible benefit to show for it.

# Java

## What Version Of JAVA JRE do I have?
> you can get the precise version string from your installed JRE by opening a command window, cding to your JRE's binaries folder, and doing java -version. For example, on my laptop I do
````bash
C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin>java -version
java version "1.7.0_51"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_51-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 24.51-b03, mixed mode, sharing)
This is JRE 1.7.0 update 51, or just 'Java 7 update 51'.

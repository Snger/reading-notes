# Groovy
> A multi-faceted language for the Java platform
> Apache Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-typing and static compilation capabilities, for the Java platform aimed at improving developer productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and functional programming.

## Configuring Groovy SDK within IntelliJ
> IntelliJ IDEA expects the standard Groovy SDK layout which is provided with the official distributions available at http://groovy-lang.org/download.html. Just download, unpack into any directory, specify this directory as the library home.
> Homebrew package layout may be different, however it may have the standard layout in the libexec subdirectory in some cases. Try /usr/local/opt/groovy/libexec.
> Sdkman (sdkman.io) makes it really simple to install groovy and switch versions (at the command line at least)

# Using Makefiles
> When building large, maintainable C programs (with multiple entry points and shared code), the use of Makefiles is paramount. In this course, students must submit their projects using Makefiles to automate the build process of their C program(s). This will allow our graders to more quickly grade student submissions and provide timely feedback.

## Concepts to Know
> A basic understanding of Makefiles is all that is necessary for your own projects; however, the following concepts are also very useful:

Targets and dependencies
Comments (always useful!)
Variables (compiler, flags, etc.)
Calling make from the command line
